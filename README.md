# 2 Overview

This repository was created to support a presentation at the
International Society of Nurses in Genetics:

Heinsberg LW. Statistical Tools to Support Implementation: Variable
Selection and Post-Selection Inference in Genomic Nursing Research.
$$Expert Lecturer Abstract, Podium$$. Presented at the International
Society of Nurses in Genetics, November 2024, San Diego, California.

The goal of this repository is to provide detailed code and a synthetic
example data set to guide nurse scientists and other researchers in
performing variable selection with a bootstrapping stability
investigation to support valid post-selection inference.

A case study with example code is presented in CaseStudy.Rmd.

# 4 Acknowledgments

This work was made possible through support from the National Institutes
of Health under award numbers K99HD107030 and R00HD107030. I also extend
my deepest gratitude to Dr.Â Daniel Weeks, who first introduced me to
variable selection and post-selection inference. His support has been
instrumental in shaping both what I do in science and how I approach it.

**Why did the statistician break up with their favorite variable?** *It
was unstable.*
